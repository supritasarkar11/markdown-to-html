# Markdown to HTML Converter This is a simple, single-file web application that converts a local Markdown file (`input.md`) into styled HTML and renders it directly in your browser. It's designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to deploy. ## Features * Markdown to HTML Conversion: Utilizes the `marked.js` library to parse Markdown syntax into standard HTML. * Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, adaptive user interface. * Single-File Application: All necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within `index.html`, making it highly portable. * Local File Loading: Fetches and renders `input.md` directly from the same directory as `index.html`. ## How to Use To run this application, follow these simple steps: 1. Save the files: Ensure `index.html` and `input.md` are in the *same directory* on your computer. 2. Open `index.html`: Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer, or open it with your web browser. 3. View Content: The `input.md` content will automatically be loaded, converted, and displayed as beautifully formatted HTML. ## Project Structure ``` . ├── index.html # The main application file └── input.md # The Markdown file to be converted and displayed └── README.md # This file └── LICENSE # Project license information ``` ## Technologies Used * HTML5: For the page structure. * Tailwind CSS (CDN): For utility-first styling and responsive design. * Marked.js (CDN): For efficient Markdown parsing and conversion. * JavaScript (ES6+): For fetching the Markdown file and dynamically updating the DOM. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. ## Contributing Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, or submit pull requests if you have suggestions for improvements or bug fixes.
